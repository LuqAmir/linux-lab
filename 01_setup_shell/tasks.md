# Phase 1: Linux Shell Setup — "Your First Day on the Server"

## Tasks:
- [x] Use `uname -a` and `lsb_release -a` to identify the server OS and version.
- [x] Use `df -h` and `free -m` to check storage and RAM.
- [x] Create a folder called `hostpro/` in your home directory.
- [x] Inside `hostpro/`, create folders: `www/`, `logs/`, `backups/`
- [x] Use `touch` to create a fake website index file: `index.html` with dummy text.
- [x] Use `cat`, `nano`, or `vim` to edit that file.
- [x] Navigate using `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and use `history` to review what you’ve done.
