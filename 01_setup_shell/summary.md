# Phase 1 Summary: Your First Day on the Server

## Task 1: Identify the OS
- `uname -a` shows the Linux kernel and system info.
- `lsb_release -a` shows the distro name and version (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04).
- Helps me understand the environment I'm working in.

## Task 2: System Resources
- `df -h` shows disk space usage in human-readable format.
- `free -m` shows RAM usage in megabytes.
- Useful for checking capacity before running applications.

## Task 3: Folder Structure
- I created a mock hosting structure in my home directory:
  - `www/` to store web files.
  - `logs/` for system or app logs.
  - `backups/` for backup files.
- This gives me practice in directory organization.

## Task 4: Dummy HTML File
- I created `index.html` using `touch`, then used `echo` to add simple HTML.
- This simulates preparing a website for hosting.

## Task 5: Editing Files
- Used `nano` to edit the HTML file.
- Learned to save with `Ctrl+O` and exit with `Ctrl+X`.
- Understanding text editors is key in server environments.

## Task 6: Navigation and Command History
- Practiced `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd` to move around the file system.
- Used `history` to view recently run commands.
- This builds core CLI navigation habits.
